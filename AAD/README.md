Before running the script, make sure to uncomment and fill in the necessary information.
Such as your Azure AD tenant domain, the display name, UPN, and password for the new user, as well as the name for the new group.

Please note that this script assumes you have already installed the Azure AD PowerShell module and connected to your Azure AD tenant using Connect-AzureAD. 
If you haven't installed the Azure AD PowerShell module or logged in, you can uncomment the respective lines in the script to install and authenticate before performing the Azure AD operations.

Always test the script in a controlled environment and ensure you have the necessary permissions and access rights to perform the operations.
Additionally, be careful when handling user passwords and avoid hardcoding sensitive information in your scripts.
Azure AD provides many more operations for user and group management, so you can explore the Azure AD PowerShell cmdlets documentation for further customization and automation of your Azure AD tasks.
